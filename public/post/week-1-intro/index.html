<blockquote>
<p>Makeshift office hours this week on <strong>Wednesday, Oct 5, 1030-1130 in CSE
678</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Someone asked me after class if you should be able to build your own Android
App by the time the course is over. That should have been on my &ldquo;goals of the
course slide&rdquo;, as heck yes it is a goal. In fact, after Homework 1 you&rsquo;ll have
already built your own app. It is crummy and boring, but built it you have. By
the time the course is over, hopefully you&rsquo;ll be able to build your own app
that isn&rsquo;t crummy or boring.</p>

<p>This is a weird course because it is about a specific technology. The only way
you can really learn a technology is by using it. Writing code, running code,
encountering bugs that are confusing and beyond your control, being alternately
jubilant and miserable&ndash;all these things are part of learning something like
Android. Unfortunately, for a once a week credit/no-credit class, we don&rsquo;t have
a lab component and I don&rsquo;t want to require a bunch of assignments, so I&rsquo;m just
going to be standing in front of you talking. <strong>But you will only really learn
Android if you do the assignments and mess around with the code.</strong> For that
reason I suggest you spend as much time as you can on the assignments until you
complete them.</p>

<h1 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h1>

<p>Please use <a href="http://doodle.com/poll/2ap5tvbrekccm99n">the Doodle poll</a> to pick a
time that works for you.</p>

<p>As we&rsquo;re waiting for the final Doodle results to filter in, I&rsquo;m going to have a
temporary office hours this week before we settle on a regular time.</p>

<p>This week&rsquo;s office hours is <strong>Oct 5, 1030-1130am in CSE 678</strong>. This works
for most people according to the poll. If it doesn&rsquo;t work for you, vote in the
Doodle!</p>

<p>Feel free to bring your machines to have me help install Android Studio from
scratch or to have me help troubleshoot errors you&rsquo;ve encountered doing
Homework 1. If you want to come and start Homework 1 with me sitting there,
just in case you encounter an error, that is fine by me too.</p>
