<p>Implement your own <code>RecyclerView</code> to match the images shown below. Pressing the
Floating Action Button (FAB) adds an item. Pressing the trashcan deletes the
item. Adds and deletes are animated.</p>

<p>As we talked about today,
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html"><code>RecyclerView</code></a>
is a class that facilitates displaying lists of items, and it does so
efficiently. To accomplish this it enforces the ViewHolder design pattern in
order to minimize the number of <code>findViewbyId()</code> calls, as these calls traverse
the view hierarchy and can be very expensive. <code>RecyclerView</code> also provides a
number of other benefits, including fine-grained control of child positioning,
via the
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.LayoutManager.html"><code>LayoutManager</code></a>,
and painless animations thanks to
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.ItemAnimator.html"><code>ItemAnimator</code></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Homework 4 is to implement a <code>RecyclerView</code> that looks like the images shown
below</strong>.</p>

<p>I would break this into several steps. These are somewhat specific, as many
people missed last week&rsquo;s lecture and I get the impression that the way all of
this plumbs together remains somewhat opaque. Much of this is described in
Android&rsquo;s guide to <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/material/lists-cards.html">Creating Lists and
Cards</a>, so
take a read through that as well.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Create a new Activity</strong>: This <code>Activity</code> will hold the <code>RecyclerView</code>. To
get a lot of the annoying boilerplate out of the way, I would recommend
using File | New | Activity | Gallery, and then selecting &lsquo;Basic Activity&rsquo;.
This should include a layout and a &lsquo;Floating Action Button&rsquo;, which is a
common design element on Android.</li>
<li><strong>Download the icons</strong>: You&rsquo;ll need two icons for this: a trashcan and a
white plus button to go in the FAB. Download the icons
<a href="https://design.google.com/icons/">here</a>. They are called <code>delete</code> and
<code>add</code>. Download the PNGs and put the <code>drawable-*</code> directories directly under
<code>res/</code>. You can try to use an icon importer, but I&rsquo;ve never gotten this to
work. When successful, you should be able to refer to the drawables by their
name, e.g. <code>@drawable/ic_add_white_24dp</code> in your xml.</li>
<li><strong>Include RecyclerView in a layout</strong>: As part of the generation process in
step 1, Android Studio will generate some layout files for you. These files
live in <code>res/layout/</code>, and define what your view hierarchy will look like.
Note that in your <code>Activity</code>&rsquo;s <code>onCreate()</code> method, the wizard has called
<code>setContentView()</code> with the name of your layout file. This is where we
connect the layout in the xml to the UI presented by your <code>Activity</code>. Define
a <code>RecyclerView</code> in that layout file, giving it an ID so that you can refer
to it from you <code>Activity</code> code. The Creating Lists and Cards guide above has
examples of this.</li>

<li><p><strong>Create a dummy object to display</strong>: <code>RecyclerView</code> displays lists of
objects. In the real world, this would be an object representing something,
like a Github repo or an email. You can create whatever object you want for
this. I made one called <code>FooObject</code>, the entirety of which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">public class FooObject {
 public String name;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To create these objects I also made a <code>FooFactory</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java"> public class FooFactory {
   public FooObject createFoo() {
     Random random = new Random();
     int semiRandomInt = random.nextInt(500);
     FooObject result = new FooObject();
     result.name = &quot;I am semi-random Foo #&quot; + semiRandomInt;
     return result;
   }
 }
</code></pre></li>

<li><p><strong>Define a View to represent FooObject</strong>: Adapters create Views. In our
case, we want to do this by inflating an xml file living under
<code>res/layout/</code>. You should make yours look like the image below. Note that
there are two lines. The second line has two items: a left-aligned piece of
text and a right-aligned image of a trashcan. I used two
<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/linear.html"><code>LinearLayout</code></a>s,
two
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html"><code>TextView</code></a>s,
and an
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ImageView.html"><code>ImageView</code></a>.
I wrapped everything in a
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/CardView.html"><code>CardView</code></a>
to make it look fancy.

/homework/hw4_fooView.png" alt="Closeup of Item View" /></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Create an Adapter</strong>: Extend <code>RecyclerView.Adapter</code> and implement it to
display your <code>FooObject</code>s. Again, the guide linked above will be extremely
helpful here.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Hook up the Activity</strong>: Follow the guide above to implement your
<code>onCreate()</code> method. You should now be able to run the app and find an empty
screen. Pressing the FAB will generate a little message.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Hook up the FAB</strong>: Add a <code>View.OnClickListener</code> to the FAB to add a
<code>FooObject</code> with every click.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Hook up the delete button</strong>: Add a <code>View.OnClickListener</code> to the
<code>ImageView</code> displaying the trash can that deletes the view from the
<code>Adapter</code>. To do this, I had to employ the <code>ViewHolder#getAdapterPosition()</code>
method. I also used <code>View#setTag()</code>. This is probably the trickiest part, or
at least it was the most foreign to me. Deleting the item from the dataset
is relatively simple, but getting the listener in a scope where you can call
<code>getAdapterPosition()</code> might not be immediately obvious.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Hook up animations</strong>: Make sure you are calling <code>notifyItemInserted()</code> and
<code>notifyItemRemoved()</code> when you add and remove items. This will animate the
actions and make them look pretty.</p></li>
</ol>
