      <p>Homework 2 is to choose an open source Android project and build it locally.
I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://catalyst.uw.edu/gopost/board/sudars/43331/">started a discussion
board</a> for the course and
<a href="https://catalyst.uw.edu/gopost/conversation/sudars/973883">started a thread</a>
where I&rsquo;d like people to post the projects that they choose.</p>

<p>Homework 2 (assigned on 2016-10-11) is to find an open source Android Project,
build it locally, and run it on your device/emulator. Some will be easier than
others. Some may be really hard. <strong>When you&rsquo;ve chosen and built a project, post
it on the <a href="https://catalyst.uw.edu/gopost/conversation/sudars/973883">Homework 2
thread</a> on the
message board.</strong> I&rsquo;m curious to see what you choose.</p>

<p><strong>Only choose a project someone else has posted if you have already tried a
different project but haven&rsquo;t been able to get it working.</strong> If you&rsquo;re
re-posting a project, include the previous project that you tried and the error
that kept you from building it. I basically just don&rsquo;t want the first person
that posts a simple-to-build project to ruin the experience for someone else.</p>

<p>In the real world if you&rsquo;re working on an Android project, odds are you&rsquo;ll
first have to build someone else&rsquo;s existing code. It&rsquo;s a good idea to get
familiar with it. If you&rsquo;re choosing a project from github, check out the
README for a &ldquo;Building&rdquo; section or something similar, as projects will
frequently include pointers on vagaries of the build.</p>
