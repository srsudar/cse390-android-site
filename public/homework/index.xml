      <title>Homework 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Homework 2 is to choose an open source Android project and build it locally.
I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://catalyst.uw.edu/gopost/board/sudars/43331/&#34;&gt;started a discussion
board&lt;/a&gt; for the course and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://catalyst.uw.edu/gopost/conversation/sudars/973883&#34;&gt;started a thread&lt;/a&gt;
where I&amp;rsquo;d like people to post the projects that they choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homework 2 (assigned on 2016-10-11) is to find an open source Android Project,
build it locally, and run it on your device/emulator. Some will be easier than
others. Some may be really hard. &lt;strong&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;ve chosen and built a project, post
it on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://catalyst.uw.edu/gopost/conversation/sudars/973883&#34;&gt;Homework 2
thread&lt;/a&gt; on the
message board.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m curious to see what you choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only choose a project someone else has posted if you have already tried a
different project but haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to get it working.&lt;/strong&gt; If you&amp;rsquo;re
re-posting a project, include the previous project that you tried and the error
that kept you from building it. I basically just don&amp;rsquo;t want the first person
that posts a simple-to-build project to ruin the experience for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the real world if you&amp;rsquo;re working on an Android project, odds are you&amp;rsquo;ll
first have to build someone else&amp;rsquo;s existing code. It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to get
familiar with it. If you&amp;rsquo;re choosing a project from github, check out the
README for a &amp;ldquo;Building&amp;rdquo; section or something similar, as projects will
frequently include pointers on vagaries of the build.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Homework 1</title>
      <link>https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse390a1/16au/homework/homework-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your homework for this week is to get your dev environment set up. Once it is
running, create a new app like I demonstrated in the slides (Lecture 1, see
previous post) and run it on either your device or an emulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, download and open this project in Android Studio:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/srsudar/mdr-original&#34;&gt;https://github.com/srsudar/mdr-original&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the tests and run the app on your device or emulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you get stuck email me and I will help you!!!&lt;/strong&gt; There is nothing worse
than being stuck on something like configuration or not being able to run code
that other people can run. If any of this is confusing (i.e. how do I download
and open a project?), email me and I will explain it better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right away with the &lt;code&gt;mdr-original&lt;/code&gt; project someone got an error saying that
android-22 was not found on their machine. This means the SDK for Android
version 22 is not installed, and many of you will likely see the same error.
This is not an error with the app but with your build environment, and is one
of the most common types of Android errors. Launch the SDK manager (as shown in
the slides), and install version 22. It should then work (or at least that
error should go away).&lt;/p&gt;
