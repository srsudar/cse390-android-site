    <div class="content">
      <p>Your homework this week is to pick an app that you want to build toward over
the rest of the quarter. If you can&rsquo;t think of one, you can instead follow
along with me as I work to build some sort of Github client. I also posted <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JbBoJ7OQ-DTXnoQ1DlfMFtqVEUA4J6OXE5cZsfP1gwY/edit#slide=id.g18915a6abc_0_173">a
few
examples</a>
at the end of the slides. Some of these are harder than others.</p>

<p>Feel free to come by office hours or email me to set up an appointment to
discuss an idea if you think something would work but you aren&rsquo;t sure.</p>

<p><strong>For this week I would like you to describe your app to me in a paragraph, and
provide drawings of the screens you expect to use.</strong> You can get fancy and
actually diagram them with software, or you can draw on a paper and send me a
picture. If I were doing this, I would use a whiteboard, and I don&rsquo;t expect you
to do more than I would do.</p>

<p>In your paragraph, explain if your app will need to save information on disk,
if it will use a network, if you&rsquo;ll need a server or a &lsquo;server as a service&rsquo;
(e.g. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> and what object models you
expect to need. Include anything else you think might be relevant.</p>
