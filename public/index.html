        tl;dr Implement a PreferenceAccessor object to hide the complexities of dealing with SharedPreferences every time you want to get a value. A single getter and a single test is sufficient. Send me a link to your repo. Long with Lots of Detail This week your task is to build something that saves data to disk. If you&rsquo;re creating your own app, it can be whatever you need for your use-case. For people following along with the Github Hotness application, we&rsquo;ll be making a PreferenceAccessor.

        Recap and Slides This week we talked about persisting data. This is important if you want state saved across system and app restarts. Most apps will want to store something on disk, even if it&rsquo;s not a main feature of the app. Here are the slides: Lecture 9: Persisting Data Links Saving Key-Value Sets: Android docs on saving key-values. Covers SharedPreferences especially. Saving Data in SQL Databases Firebase Realtime Database

        tl;dr Write code to parse a JSON search result from the Github search API. I recommend following this tutorial. Here is a good URL for results that are a list of repos. Muy Largo This week I want you to write a class that makes an HTTP GET request to a JSON endpoint and parses the response to turn it into a Java object. There are lots of ways you could go about doing this.

Here are the slides: Lecture 7: Threading and Network Links Parsing JSON with Retrofit Retrofit RxJava Examples RxJava and REST Tutorial on Loaders Tutorial on implementing Loaders Volley: A workhorse networking library commonly used in Android projects, though we didn&rsquo;t discuss it in class. Unlike Retrofit, it is built for general requests rather than specifically for parsing JSON.

        tl;dr Send me an email addressing the three bullet points below in the Dependency Hell section. Why are you getting that error What libraries are causing the problem How would you fix it? Send me an email with a link to your repo test class for a modal view like I describe below. If you are doing your own app, send me a file with tests. They should pass. Long Form This week the plan is to write some Robolectric tests.

        Recap and Slides This week we talked about java compilation, classpaths, and the Android build system. We even dived into the Android SDK, using a JAR viewer to look at the Throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Stub!&quot;) code in every method call of the Android SDK. Such fun. Here is a link to the slides: Lecture 6: Building and Dependencies Links The Dark Side of Jack and Jill: Great post describing the new jack compiler from the Android team.

        Your homework this week is to pick an app that you want to build toward over the rest of the quarter. If you can&rsquo;t think of one, you can instead follow along with me as I work to build some sort of Github client. I also posted a few examples at the end of the slides. Some of these are harder than others. Feel free to come by office hours or email me to set up an appointment to discuss an idea if you think something would work but you aren&rsquo;t sure.

        Recap and Slides Today we talked about designing an app. Here are the slides: Lecture 5: Designing an App One of the questions that came up was how does Mockito do its magic. The specific point was in an example like this one: Random mockRandom = mock(Random.class); int nextInt = 5; when(mockRandom.nextInt()).thenReturn(nextInt); How does Mockito take an int and apply thenReturn() successfully? In other words, say that you break down the above example to the following.
