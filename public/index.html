        tl;dr Write code to parse a JSON search result from the Github search API. I recommend following this tutorial. Here is a good URL for results that are a list of repos. Muy Largo This week I want you to write a class that makes an HTTP GET request to a JSON endpoint and parses the response to turn it into a Java object. There are lots of ways you could go about doing this.

        Recap and Slides This week we talked about processes, threads, and accessing the network. Here are the slides: Lecture 7: Threading and Network Links Parsing JSON with Retrofit Retrofit RxJava Examples RxJava and REST Tutorial on Loaders Tutorial on implementing Loaders Volley: A workhorse networking library commonly used in Android projects, though we didn&rsquo;t discuss it in class. Unlike Retrofit, it is built for general requests rather than specifically for parsing JSON.

        tl;dr Send me an email addressing the three bullet points below in the Dependency Hell section. Why are you getting that error What libraries are causing the problem How would you fix it? Send me an email with a link to your repo test class for a modal view like I describe below. If you are doing your own app, send me a file with tests. They should pass. Long Form This week the plan is to write some Robolectric tests.

        Recap and Slides This week we talked about java compilation, classpaths, and the Android build system. We even dived into the Android SDK, using a JAR viewer to look at the Throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Stub!&quot;) code in every method call of the Android SDK. Such fun. Here is a link to the slides: Lecture 6: Building and Dependencies Links The Dark Side of Jack and Jill: Great post describing the new jack compiler from the Android team.

        Your homework this week is to pick an app that you want to build toward over the rest of the quarter. If you can&rsquo;t think of one, you can instead follow along with me as I work to build some sort of Github client. I also posted a few examples at the end of the slides. Some of these are harder than others. Feel free to come by office hours or email me to set up an appointment to discuss an idea if you think something would work but you aren&rsquo;t sure.

        Recap and Slides Today we talked about designing an app. Here are the slides: Lecture 5: Designing an App One of the questions that came up was how does Mockito do its magic. The specific point was in an example like this one: Random mockRandom = mock(Random.class); int nextInt = 5; when(mockRandom.nextInt()).thenReturn(nextInt); How does Mockito take an int and apply thenReturn() successfully? In other words, say that you break down the above example to the following.

        tl;dr Implement your own RecyclerView to match the images shown below. Pressing the Floating Action Button (FAB) adds an item. Pressing the trashcan deletes the item. Adds and deletes are animated. tl; but will still r As we talked about today, RecyclerView is a class that facilitates displaying lists of items, and it does so efficiently. To accomplish this it enforces the ViewHolder design pattern in order to minimize the number of findViewbyId() calls, as these calls traverse the view hierarchy and can be very expensive.

        Recap and Slides Today we talked mostly about ListView, Adapters, and RecyclerView. Plus a bit on Fragments. This felt like the most boring lecture to date to me. Too much stepping through too much code, seemed to be the consensus. Here are the code-heavy slides. Here are the slides: Lecture 4: Advanced UI Links General links: Creating Lists and Cards Mastering Coordinator Layout: A good overview, with gifs, about Coordinator Layout.

        tl;dr Check out the branch failing-tests-1 from the mdr-original project you built for Homework 1. Many tests should fail. Fix both the tests in the android and androidTests configurations. Some rules: DO NOT CHANGE THE TESTS: You should not have to edit any test code to get these to pass. All changes should be made in non-test Java files and in xml files. If you think you found a reason you need to change test code, and you REALLY REALLY REALLY think you&rsquo;re right, email me and ask.
