Your homework this week is to pick an app that you want to build toward over
the rest of the quarter. If you can't think of one, you can instead follow
along with me as I work to build some sort of Github client. I also posted [a
few
examples](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JbBoJ7OQ-DTXnoQ1DlfMFtqVEUA4J6OXE5cZsfP1gwY/edit#slide=id.g18915a6abc_0_173)
at the end of the slides. Some of these are harder than others.

Feel free to come by office hours or email me to set up an appointment to
discuss an idea if you think something would work but you aren't sure.

**For this week I would like you to describe your app to me in a paragraph, and
provide drawings of the screens you expect to use.** You can get fancy and
actually diagram them with software, or you can draw on a paper and send me a
picture. If I were doing this, I would use a whiteboard, and I don't expect you
to do more than I would do.

In your paragraph, explain if your app will need to save information on disk,
if it will use a network, if you'll need a server or a 'server as a service'
(e.g. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and what object models you
expect to need. Include anything else you think might be relevant.
