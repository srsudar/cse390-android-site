# Final Project Submission

For the final project you had the option of either following along with me,
making a 'Github Hotness' app, or of building an app of your own design. For
your final homework, **send me a link to your repo for the project** with a
description of the app.

Also, **PLEASE** complete the course evaluation. See my email for more
information.
