# Recap and Slides

This week we talked about java compilation, classpaths, and the Android build
system. We even dived into the Android SDK, using a JAR viewer to look at the
`Throw new RuntimeException("Stub!")` code in every method call of the Android
SDK. Such fun. Here is a link to the slides:

    Dependencies](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DZ0RjEiTwwyJrn30V640NOE8NPmIY615yQ3TCJND0Ck/edit?usp=sharing)

* [The Dark Side of Jack and
    Jill](http://trickyandroid.com/the-dark-world-of-jack-and-jill/):
    Great post describing the new jack compiler from the Android team. To get
    into the meat of jack, it first covers in detail the classic compilation
    toolchain.
