To try and better accommodate overloads, we have moved rooms to [Guggenheim
218](https://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/gug). It has windows and lacks a giant
pillar in the middle of the room, so that is a win.

My inbox has been relatively quiet, given how finicky Android Studio can be. If
you get stuck, let me know.
