# Links

In class today I talked about how I don't like `Fragment`s. I think they are
more trouble than they are worth, and come with a very complex lifecycle that
is the source of many bugs. Here are some links discussing similar things.

* [Advocating Against Android
    Fragments](https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/advocating-against-android-fragments-81fd0b462c97#.3j91byiex):
A really great overview on testable UI in Android, and the trouble `Fragment`s
gave them. Highly recommended.

    Lifecycle](https://github.com/xxv/android-lifecycle)
