# Recap and Slides

Today we talked mostly about `ListView`, `Adapter`s, and `RecyclerView`. Plus a
bit on `Fragment`s. This felt like the most boring lecture to date to me. Too
much stepping through too much code, seemed to be the consensus. Here are the
code-heavy slides.

Here are the slides:

* [Lecture 4: Advanced
    UI](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HWFSFgZXn0Ncr_qfrdBjYq_Ho_YehIfTldghHxpVigc/edit?usp=sharing)

# Links

General links:

* [Creating Lists and
    Cards](https://developer.android.com/training/material/lists-cards.html)
* [Mastering Coordinator
    Layout](http://saulmm.github.io/mastering-coordinator): A good overview,
    with gifs, about [Coordinator
    Layout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/CoordinatorLayout.html).

In class today I talked about how I don't like `Fragment`s. I think they are
more trouble than they are worth, and come with a very complex lifecycle that
is the source of many bugs. Here are some links discussing similar things.

* [Advocating Against Android
    Fragments](https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/advocating-against-android-fragments-81fd0b462c97#.3j91byiex):
A really great overview on testable UI in Android, and the trouble `Fragment`s
gave them. Highly recommended.
* [No Fragments, Rich Views](http://www.briangriffey.com/blog/1)
* [The Complete and Hairy Android
    Lifecycle](https://github.com/xxv/android-lifecycle)
