Someone asked me after class if you should be able to build your own Android
App by the time the course is over. That should have been on my "goals of the
course slide", as heck yes it is a goal. In fact, after Homework 1 you'll have
already built your own app. It is crummy and boring, but built it you have. By
the time the course is over, hopefully you'll be able to build your own app
that isn't crummy or boring.

This is a weird course because it is about a specific technology. The only way
you can really learn a technology is by using it. Writing code, running code,
encountering bugs that are confusing and beyond your control, being alternately
jubilant and miserable--all these things are part of learning something like
Android. Unfortunately, for a once a week credit/no-credit class, we don't have
a lab component and I don't want to require a bunch of assignments, so I'm just
going to be standing in front of you talking. **But you will only really learn
Android if you do the assignments and mess around with the code.** For that
reason I suggest you spend as much time as you can on the assignments until you
complete them.
