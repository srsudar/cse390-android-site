# Recap and Slides

This week we talked about the Android lifecycle. Here is a link to the slides:

* [Lecture 2: Android Lifecycle](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bKBzo0rbi8NsmZc15VpX6DXrIJ4zPMX71EBpYIR2k2o/edit#slide=id.g183ccd2a56_0_5)

I've created a repo called [cse390-android-playground](https://github.com/srsudar/cse390-android-playground)
that I'll keep updating over the course of the quarter to demonstrate small,
bite-sized pieces of code outside of a coherent app context. As the README
there indicates, it is organized by branches. This week check out
`intent-basics` and `lifecycle-logs` and mess around with the code.

Here are some more links you might find useful. Some of the images on the
slides came from these pages, and they provide a lot more detail:
